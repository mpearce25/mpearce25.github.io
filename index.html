        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <h4>Limits describe how the outputs of a function f behave as x approaches a value of C. The value that the function approaches is denoted by the letter L. </h4>
        <img class = 'centerimage'  src='images/limit_def.png'>
             
        <h2>Properties of Limits</h2>
        <h4>These rules allow you to analytically determine the limits of both polynomial and rational functions. By applying these rules and determining the limits of individual parts of a function, limits of complicated functions can be found.

            <hr></hr>
            <h3>Sum Rule</h3>
            <img class = "centerimage" src="images/sum_rule.png">
            <h4>To find the limit of a two functions that are being added together simply find the sum of the limits of the individual functions. </h4>
            <hr></hr>
            
    <h3>Difference Rule</h3>
            <img class = "centerimage" src="images/diff_rule.png">
    <h4>Similar to the sum rule, to find the limit of two functions that are being subtracted, you can just take the difference of the individual limits.</h4>

    <h3>Product Rule</h3>
            <img class = "centerimage" src="images/product_rule.png">
    <h4>To find the limit of two functions being multiplied, you can just multiply the limits of the individual functions.</h4>

            <h2>Finding Limits Graphically &amp; Numerically</h2>
    
    <h3>Numerically</h3>
    <h4>By making a table of the x and f(x) values extremely close to the point x approaches you are able to determine the limit. This also particularly useful for finding the limit even when the function is not defined at the point, because you still see the value that f(x) approaches as x→ a. To ensure precision you should use at a minimum x values within .01 of the value x approaches. </h4>
    <h4>For example in this AP problem from the Barron's AP Calc review book, the value of the limit can be found using the following table. </h4>
    
     <img class = "centerimage" src="images/table_example.jpg" style="width: 50%">
    <br></br>
    <table border="1" style="width:85%; border-collapse: collapse;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center">

<h4>As you can see the as x approaches -1 f(x) approaches 2.</h4>
    
    <h3>Graphically</h3>
    <h4>To find the limit graphically you can can graph the function you are trying to find the limit of and then simply by looking at the graph see the value f(x) approaches. If it is difficult to determine the exact value f(x) approaches you can use your calculators tool to find f(x) at any x value. </h4>
   
<h4>For example in this AP problem from the Grey &amp; Maroon AP prep book, the value of the limit can be found with graphs.</h4>
<img class = "centerimage" src="images/limit_graphical_example.png" style="width: 70%">
 <img class = "centerimage" src="images/limit_graphical2.png" style="width: 50%">
<h4>As you can see as x --> infinity the limit is 3 as x --> +infinity, and -7 as x --> -infinity.</h4>
    
            <h2>Right and Left Hand Limits</h2>
    <h4>The limit of a function can be broken up into both a <strong>right hand</strong> and <strong>left hand limit</strong>. The process for finding these limits is basically the same as finding general limits; however, a function such can approach a different value from the right and left and sides. This is a key concept when evaluating continuity at a point. In the discontinuous function below you can see how from the right hand side the function approaches one value and from the left hand side it approaches another value at x =1. </h4>
    <img class = "centerimage" src="images/discon_ex1.png" style="width: 50%">
    <h4>The notation for the right and left hand limits approaching the value 'C' is as follows. </h4>

    <h2>Asymptotes </h2>
    
    <h3>Horizontal Asymptotes</h3>
    <h4>By evaluating the limit of a function as the x value approaches 土infinity you are able to find the horizontal asymptote of a function. This is true as long as the value the function approaches is a rational number. It is also important to keep in mind that a function can have multiple horizontal asymptotes as it does not have to approach the same value when going to + infinity and - infinity. </h4>
    <img src="images/horizontal_as.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:40%;">
    <h4>To evaluate limits as x → 土 infinity you can use the same rules used to evaluate limits as x → C, where C is any constant. </h4>


    <h4>**Barron's AP Problem**</h4>
  <img src="images/hor_ex1.png" class = "centerimage" style="width:80%;">
    
    <h3>Vertical Asymptotes</h3>
    <h4>A vertical asymptote occurs when the right or left hand limit of a function is 土 infinity as x approaches a certain value. In the example below a vertical asymptote occurs at x = 0.</h4>
    <img src="images/vertical_as.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:40%;">
    
    
    
            <h2>Application - Continuity </h2>
        <h4>Limits can be used to determine whether a function has continuity at a point. If a limit fails to exist at point C, C is a <i><strong>point of discontinuity</strong></i> and the entire function is considered <i><strong>discontinuous</strong></i>. Continuity at a point can be tested for interior points by evaluating the right and left hand limits as x → C. Additionally the the value at x = a must exist.</h4>
    <h3>If the limit fails to exist from either side, or the right and left handed limits are not equal the limit at that point does not exist. </h3>
    <h4>To find if a function with the domain [a,b] is continuous at endpoints, the right hand limit, <img src="images/righthand_limit_end.png" style="width:20
        %; height: 50px;">, must exist for the function to be continuous at a right endpoint. The left hand limit, <img src="images/lefthand_limit_end.png" style="width:20
        %; height: 50px;">, must exist for the function to be continuous at a left endpoint. A function is continuous if it is <i><strong>continuous</strong></i> at every point in its domain. </h4>

    <h2>Intermediate Value Theorem</h2>
    <h4>The intermediate Value theorem for continuous states that the function f(x), that is continuous on the closed interval of [a,b] will take on every value between f(a) and f(b). It is important to realize that this theorem only applies if f(x) is continuous at EVERY point in the interval [a,b].</h4>
    
    <img src="images/intermediate.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:50%;">
        <h2>Average Rates of Change and Secants Lines</h2>
            
    
        <h4>The <strong>average rate of change</strong> of a function over an interval is the amount of change divided by the length of the interval.</h4>  
    <h4>This “average rate of change” between point ‘a’ and ‘b’ is equivalent to the slope of the <strong>secant line</strong> which passes through points ‘a’ and ‘b’.</h4>  
    
    <h4>By combining this concept with limits it is possible to evaluate the <strong>instantaneous rate of change</strong> of a function at a given point.</h4>
    
    <h4>To find this make the two points on the secant line P and Q.Make point P the value of x at which you want to determine the instantaneous speed. Then make the second point an arbitrary point ‘Q’ and then find the limiting value of Q as it approaches ‘P’. <br></br>This gives you the instantaneous rate of change at point ‘P’. </h4>  
    <h4>This instantaneous rate of change is equivalent to the slope of the tangent line that passes through point ‘P’. </h4>
    
    <h4> In other words, the slope ‘m’ of the tangent line, at point P(a, f(a)) in function f(x), when x = a, is equal to <br></br><img src="images/deriv_limit.png" class = "centerimage" style="width:35%"> <br></br>as long as the limit exists at this point. </h4>
    
<h3>This can be demonstrated in the viewer below. By making the value of ‘H’ (the blue dot) closer to that of ‘A’ (red dot) the variable ‘m’ approaches the slope of the tangent line at x = a (this is the black line when h is infinitely close to A). </h3>

        <h4>The derivative of f, denoted as f’, at 'a' is the instantaneous rate of change (slope of tangent line), of a function 'f' when x = a. For this value to exist the limit must exist at the point ‘a’ and the function must be continuous at that point.</h4>

        <h2>Derivatives &amp; Limits</h2>
        <h3>Derivatives employ many of the same concepts as limits. </h3>
        <h4>A function is considered <strong>differentiable</strong> on a closed interval [a,b] if it has a derivative at every interior point. Additionally the limits at the endpoints must exist. To test if the limit exists at a right enpoint, 'b', take the righthand limit at that point.</h4>

        <h4>In a differentiable function like x<sup>2</sup> this occurs at every point. In non-differentiable functions such as |x|, the graph does not have local linearity at x = 0. </h4>

<h3>Finding Inverse Derivatives</h3>    
<h4>Algebra concepts show that an inverse of a function can be obtained by reflecting the graph over the line y = x. This holds true for the inverse of tangent lines, by reflecting the line tangent to (a, f(a)) over the line y = x it becomes tangent to the graph of f<sup>-1</sup> at (f(a), a). Furthermore the slope of the line tangent to the inverse function will have a slope that is the reciprocal of the original slope (provided the slope is not 0).</h4>

        <h2> Chain Rule</h2>
        <h4>The chain rule is key for evaluating the derivatives of composite functions. While not always visible the chain rule is used whenever evaluating the derivative of any function.</h4>
        
<h3>Definition</h3>
<h4>The chain rule states that if the function f is differentiable at g(x) and the function g is differentiable at x, then f(g(x)) is differentiable at x. <br></br>Additionally it states that: the derivative of f(g(x)) is equivalent to the derivative of the outside function, f’ ,at the value of the inside function g(x), multiplied by the derivative of the inside g’. </h4>

<h2>Finding Tangent and Normal Lines </h2>
<h3>Tangent Lines</h3>
<h4>To find the equation of a line tangent to a graph at a the value x = a and f(a) = k one should start with the point slope form of a linear line which is (y-k) = m(x - a).</h4>
<h4>Then you can take the derivative at x = a and also evaluate the function at x = a to find the value of k. Then by plugging in those values you get the equation of the line tangent to (a,k).</h4>

<h3>Normal Lines</h3>
<h4>A line normal to any function is the line that intersects the function’s graph at a right angle (perpendicular). Therefore it is known that the slope of a normal line is the opposite reciprocal of the first line. This makes the equation for the line normal to a function at (a,k).</h4>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<h4>The use of tables to evaluate a derivative returns to the idea of finding the slope of a secant line as one point gets infinitely close to the point where you are evaluating the derivative at. </h4>
<h4>By finding the numerical values near f(x) on either side of and at  x and then finding the average rate of change between a selection of these points you will get a very close approximation of the derivative. </h4>

        <h1>Implicit Differentiation</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h4>The chain rule is critical when solving implicitly defined functions. 
</h4>
    <h4>Implicit differentiation allows the derivative (slope of tangent line) to be found in functions where the x and y variables are mixed together and the previous methods for finding derivatives do not work. </h4>
    <h4>The key is to treat the variable y as a differentiable function of x and then differentiate both sides of the equation <strong>with respect to x</strong>. This means 3y = 2xy is now really as 3y(x) = 2(x)(y(x)), and that y’ = (dy/dx). </h4>
    <h4>This is useful for various real life situations in addition to finding the instantaneous rate of change on shapes such as a circle whose formula is x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 25 .</h4>
    
    <h3> Implicit Differentiation Process</h3> 
    <h4>First: Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x.</h4>
    <h4>Second: Gather all the terms with (dy/dx)onto one side of the equation</h4>
    <h4>Third: Factor out (dy/dx)</h4>
    <h4>Fourth: Isolate / Solve For (dy/dx)</h4>
    <h3>This process is illustrated in the following AP problem from the Grey &amp; Maroon Prep book.</h3>
    
<h2>Applications</h2>

        <h1>Basic Applications of Derivatives</h1>
    <h2>Position, Velocity, and Acceleration</h2>
    <h4>Derivatives can be used in the real world to find the position, velocity, and acceleration of objects at any given time. Whenever taking the derivative in these situations it is key to take them with respect to time. Those variables are related in the following ways.</h4>
    <h3>(Instantaneous) Velocity</h3>
    <h4>(Instantaneous) Velocity is the derivative of the position function s = f(t)  with respect to t. </h4>
    <img src="images/velocity.png" class="centerimage">
    <h4>This is because velocity is the change in position over a certain time, resultingly when taking the derivative of the position function you get the instantaneous velocity (change in position) at time t. This is in constratst to the slope of a secant line which would give the average rate of change over a certain period of time.</h4>
     <h4>This also means that if position is increasing at a constant rate then acceleration will be constant, and if the position is constant that acceleration = 0.</h4>
        
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <h4>Speed and velocity while closely related are not the same. Velocity is a vector, while speed is a magnitude. This means that Velocity has a direction (usually indicated by  a + or - sign for basic equations) while speed is only a value. Therefore speed since it is always positive is the absolute value of velocity. 
</h4>
        <img src="images/speed.png" class="centerimage">
    
    <h3>Acceleration</h3>
        <h4>Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function v(t) and the second derivative of the position function with respect to t. 
</h4>
        <img src="images/acceleration.png" class="centerimage">
    <h4>This is because acceleration is instantaneous rate of change in velocity. </h4>
    <h4>This also means that if velocity is increasing at a constant rate then acceleration will be constant, and if instantaneous velocity is constant that acceleration = 0.</h4>
    
    <h3>Uses of higher order derivatives</h3>
    <h4>By taking higher order derivatives you can continue to find the instantaneous rates of change of objects. The derivative of acceleration yields the <strong>jerk</strong> of an object. Beyond that the derivatives are referred to as: snap, crackle, and pop.</h4>
    
    
    <h2>Application to Particle Motion</h2>
    
    <h3>Graphical</h3>
    <h4>Using the concepts behind the above analytical methods allows you to view a velocity time or position time graph and determine when a particle is: slowing down, speeding up, accelerating, decelerating, and much more. </h4>

<h4>Find the derivative of the function using implicit differentiation.</h4>

        <h1>Antiderivatives &amp; Mean Value Theorem</h1>
    <h2>Mean Value Theorem</h2>
    <h4>The mean value theorem states that if f(x) is continuous at every point on the closed interval [a,b] and differentiable at every point of its interior (a,b) then there is at least one point c in (a,b) where<img src="images/mean_value.png"  style="width:35%"></h4> 
    
    <h4>In other words this means that the instantaneous rate of change of a function at, at least one point is equivalent to the average rate of change of the function from a to b. </h4>
    
    <h2>Antiderivatives</h2>
    <h4>Employing the concept of the mean value theorem antiderivatives can be found through the process of antidifferentiation. Antidifferentiation employs many of the same rules used to take derivatives but in reverse. </h4>
    <h4>For example we know that f’(x) of a constant function is 0. Applying that in reverse, the antiderivative of a zero function must be a constant function.</h4>

    <img src="images/extrema.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:60%;">
    <h3>Local Minimum</h3>
    <h4>For interior points, a local minimum occurs at x = c  when f(x) is greater than  f(c) for all values in a given open interval.</h4>
    <h3>Local Maximum</h3>
        <h4>For interior points, a local maximum occurs at x = c  when f(x) is less than  f(c) for all values in a given open interval.</h4>

    <h3>Global (Absolute) Minimum </h3>
        <h4>A absolute minimum occurs at at x = c when f(c) is less than all other values f(x) within the functions domain. </h4>
    
    <h2>Finding Extrema With Derivatives</h2>
    <h4>A function on a closed interval has local extrema at its endpoints and it potentially has local extrema at critical points. </h4>
    <h3>Endpoints</h3>
    <h4>According to the <strong>extreme value theorem</strong> on a closed interval [a,b], a function will have local extrema at both of its endpoints. </h4>
    <h4>If a function only has a closed interval on one side then only that endpoint will be an extreme value. It is also possible for a function to have no endpoints such as a function defined on the interval (a,b).</h4>
    
    <h3>Critical Points</h3>
    <h4>A critical point is defined as a point where the derivative of a function either equals 0 or fails to exist. </h4>
    <h3>Finding Critical Points</h3>
    <h4>To find a critical point take the derivative of a function and then find what points make the derivative equal to 0 or make it fail to exist. </h4>

  
    
    
    <h4>To test if a extrema occurs the <strong>first derivative test</strong> is used. </h4>
    <h2>First Derivative Test</h2>
    <h4>To test if a extrema occurs at critical points and determine if it is a local max or min the first derivative test is employed.</h4>
    <h4>The easiest way to organize perform the test is by making a table and labeling the intervals of the function between its critical points. </h4>
    <h4>For example to find the critical points in the function  5x<sup>3</sup> - 3x that are extrema follow the steps below.</h4>
    <img src="images/interval_ex.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:80%;">
    
    
    
    
    <h4>If the sign of the derivative changes from positive to negative at a critical point that means a local maximum exists at that point. </h4>
    <img src="images/local_max.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:45%;">
    <h4>If the sign of the derivative changes from positive to negative at a critical points, the function has a local minimum at that point. </h4>
    <img src="images/local_min.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:45%;">
    <h4>If there is no change in sign of the derivative at a critical point it means that an extreme value does not occur at that point. This occurs in graphs such as the below graph of x<sup>3</sup> at x = 0.</h4>
    <img src="images/x_cube.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:45%;">
    <span style="padding:  150px;"></span>
    
    <h4>Once you have determined whether each critical point or endpoint is in fact an extreme value you would be required to explain your result and how you came to that conclusion based on your table made while performing the first derivative test. For example if a local extreme value occured at x = 1, you may say: "Since the sign of the derivative changed from negative to positive at x = 1 proving a local minimum occurs". This would be an example of employing the verbal model in calculus.</h4>

    <h2>Finding Extrema Graphically</h2>
    <h2>By examining a graph it is possible to easily determine where extrema occur. It is best to confirm the exact x value of the extreme value by using the calculators function to find maximums and minimums. </h2>
    <img src="images/extreme_function.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:45%;">
    <h4>In the function above it is clear that a local maximum occurs somewhere around -1/2 and that a min occurs around 1/2. When you confirm using your calculator you find the exact values to be -.447 and .447.</h4>
    
    
    
    <h2>Second Derivative Test</h2>
    <h4>Instead of relying on the first derivative test to determine where extreme values occur,in some situations it is possible to directly identify extrema through the second derivative test. </h4>
    <h3>Concanvity</h3>
    <h4>Concavity is key to understanding why the second derivative test works. </h4>
    <h4>Concavity describes whether a function is open up or down. This is best illustrated in the below graph. </h4>
    
    <img src="images/first_conc.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:45%;">
    <h4>When the f’(x) is increasing a function is concave up and when f’(x) is decreasing a function is concave down. However the second derivative of a function conveys the same information by examining whether it is positive or negative.<br></br>A negative second derivative is the same as a decreasing first derivative, which means the function is concave down. A positive second derivative is the same as a increasing first derivative, which means the function is concave up.  </h4>
    
    <img src="images/second_conc.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:45%;">
    
    <h3>The Test</h3>
    <h4>If you look at extreme values it is clear that an interior local minimum is concave up while a interior max is concave down. Therefore if f’(c) = 0 and f’’(c) < 0 a local maximum occurs. If f’(c) = 0 and f’’(c) > 0 then a local minimum occurs at x = c. </h4>
        <h4>By using a similar table to the first derivative test you can analytically find the extrema using. The process is shown below.</h4>
        <h4>**Grey &amp; Maroon AP Problem**</h4>
<img class = "centerimage" src="images/conc.png" style = "width: 75%;">
        <h4>However if f’’(c) = 0 or fails to exist no conclusions can be drawn and you must resort to the first derivative test. </h4>
        
        <h2>Points of inflection</h2>
        <h4>A point of inflection is where the concavity of a function changes. To find points of inflection the second derivative test is used. Much in the same way as finding extrema with the first derivative test, you are looking for a change in the sign of f’’(x). This can be especially useful when graphing equations by hand or for further analyzing functions. </h4>

        <h1>Linearization &amp; Differentials</h1>
    <h2>Linearization</h2>
    <h4>Linearization allows for you to approximate values of a function near a point of tangency. This works because as long as you stay relatively close to the point of tangency, the tangent line provides as fair representation of the actual curve. </h4>
    <h4>This is incredibly useful for calculating values of functions such as the sqrt(1.02) or sin(pi - .02) without the need of a calculator. </h4>
    <h4>To find the equation L(x) of the tangent line at the point x = a you use the equation L(x) = f(a) + f’(a)(x-a). By using a value of ‘a’ near to the desired x value you ensure a more accurate approximation.  After finding the equation you plug in the x value you want to find and the linearization will give you an approximation of that value. </h4>
    <h4>However, since it is just an approximation it will always over or underestimate. It is possible to determine which will occur by examining the concavity of the function at x = a. If the function is concave down, the linearization will overestimate, while if the function is concave up the linearization will underestimate. </h4>
    
    <h3>Example AP Problem</h3>
    <h4>Use linearization to estimate the sqrt(171).</h4>
    
    <h2>Differentials</h2>
    <h4>Differentials are used to find ‘dy’, the estimated change in y, based upon a certain change in x known as ‘dx’. Differentials, similar to linearization, use the tangent line at a point to estimate the change, so the ‘dy’ value you find will not give the exact change in a function from a to a + dx, but it should be very close as long as ‘dx’ is minimal. </h4>
    
    <img src="images/dy.png" class="centerimage"  style="width:50%;">
    <h4>The equation to find dy is dy = f’(a)dx</h4>
    <h3>Using differentials to evaluate change</h3>
    <h4>This simple example shows how to find ‘dy’ in the function y = 5x<sup>2</sup> + 4x when ‘dx’ is .02 and x = 3.</h4>
    <h4>You start by taking the derivative of both sides and get</h4>
    <h3>dy = (10x + 4) dx</h3>
    <h4>Then substitute in the values for dx and x.</h4>
